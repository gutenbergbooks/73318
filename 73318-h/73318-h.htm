</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> these days, when it is the fashion to decry
Mont Blanc, in company with a good many other
old institutions, there is one thing about the
mountain which is apt to be lost sight of, and
that is how very fatal it has been to mountaineers.
It is quite possible that the proportion of killed
to those who succeed in the ascent—and the same
will hold good in respect of any other Alpine
peak—would not be found to be great, for probably
more people have gone up Mont Blanc than
any other high mountain; but no number of
successful ascents will minimise the fact that
there can be very real danger on Mont Blanc.
The causes of danger are not far to seek. The
mountain is regarded, and in fact is, comparatively
easy of ascent; and from the days when
Albert Smith did so much to dispel the awe with
which it was once the fashion to regard it, the
popularity of the expedition has grown year by
year, till quite a considerable percentage of those
who now go to Chamouni consider but the half
of their visit accomplished if they fail to ‘do’
Mont Blanc. Thus it comes to pass that a great
number of individuals are allowed to ascend who
ought not to go on the mountain at all, and
who, under certain conditions, may easily become
a source of danger to themselves and to those who
accompany them.</p>

<p>But the danger from this cause is as nothing
compared with that which exists in the inferior
quality of many of the guides. At Chamouni,
every one who styles himself a guide must belong
to a kind of trades-union society called the ‘Compagnie
des Guides,’ and presided over by a
‘Guide-chef.’ All who enter the ‘Compagnie des
Guides,’ good, bad, and indifferent, enter it on the
same footing, and are compelled to take their turn
for an engagement on a register kept at the office
of the ‘Guide-chef’ for the purpose. Thus, a
traveller who wishes to engage a guide, is not
allowed—except under very special circumstances—to
choose his man, but must take him whose
name stands first on the list; and it may so
happen that quite an incompetent individual is
given charge of a party wishing to ascend Mont
Blanc, while a really good guide is told off to
carry a knapsack over the Col de Balme.</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine what may result from
a system such as this. For one thing, it has
had the effect of utterly demoralising Chamouni
guides as a body; and it has been the means,
as we shall see presently, of some of the worst
accidents that have ever happened in the Alps.
It is usual nowadays for members of Alpine
Clubs to bring to Chamouni their own guides
from other districts, rather than trust to the
local men; and so it has come about that
Chamouni guides have been reduced to taking
casual parties up Mont Blanc, with the result,
that very few of them are of any use out of
their own particular district, and as regards the
more difficult peaks of the range, very little
even in it. In fact, it is hardly an exaggeration
to say that the really good Chamouni men may
now be counted on the fingers. The grave scandal
occasioned by the desertion of the Russian, Professor
Fedchenko, by his guides—two inexperienced
boys—and his subsequent death on the Mer
de Glace, called forth a severe protest against the
Chamouni guide system on the part of the
Alpine Club; but beyond some slight modification
of the rules as regards the choosing of
special men, very little has been done; and to
this day the Rules and Regulations of the
‘Compagnie des Guides’ of Chamouni remain a
byword with all mountaineers.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the danger—and this perhaps
greatest of all—from weather. Easy though Mont
Blanc may be as long as the weather is good, there
is not a mountain in all the Alps which can
become so dangerous in a storm. Every one who
has had experience of climbing, knows how
weather can affect a mountain, and how an
ascent which is easy enough one day, may
become dangerous if not impossible the next.
It is quite a mistake to suppose that because a
mountain offers no <i>physical</i> difficulties, that there
is no risk attending the ascent. We have Mont<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">{514}</span>
Blanc as a case in point. Easiest of all the Great
mountains, he has proved himself the most fatal
of any.</p>

<p>The first accident within our knowledge
which occurred on Mont Blanc was that to Dr
Hamel’s party in 1820, and being the first accident
to Alpine climbers, it created at the time
an immense sensation. From accounts published
by the survivors, it seems clear that the accident
was caused by ignorance of the state of the snow—ignorance
excusable enough in those days, when
as a matter of fact the art of climbing was very
little understood. On August 18, 1820, a Russian
professor, Dr Hamel; two Oxonians, Messrs
Durnford and Henderson; a Genevese named
Sellique; and twelve guides, left Chamouni, and
in twelve hours—about double the time now
taken—reached the rocks of the Grands Mulets.
Here they pitched a tent which they had
brought with them, and passed the night. Bad
weather came on after sunset; and as it did not
clear next morning in time for them to start,
they had to pass another night in the tent. It
came on to rain again in the evening; but the
following morning, August 20, was fine, and it
was determined to make a push for the summit.
At this juncture, M. Sellique was overcome with
‘scruples’ on the subject of making the ascent,
and declined to accompany the others, so he was
left behind in charge of two of the guides. The
rest of the party set out at five <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> The
weather kept fine; but the snow—to quote one
of the survivors—was found to be ‘rather too
soft.’ They would appear to have followed the
line of ascent usually adopted in these days,
until opposite the Dome du Goûté, and on a
level with it, when they branched off sharply
to the left, and commenced to traverse a steep
snow-slope, directing their course straight for
the Mont Maudit. They were not roped, and
were apparently proceeding in Indian file, when
suddenly the snow gave beneath their feet, and
carried them away bodily down the slope. They
were all carried a great distance—some accounts
say twelve hundred feet—and then the whole
avalanche buried itself in a great crevasse. The
three leading guides were completely overwhelmed;
but the rest of the party stopped short
of the crevasse, and were saved. The survivors
made frantic efforts to rescue their unfortunate
companions; but the poor fellows must have
been buried under many tons of snow, and these
efforts were unavailing.</p>

<p>It was scarcely thought probable that trace of
them would ever again be found; but after the
lapse of nearly half a century, the glacier yielded
up its dead. In 1863, or forty-three years after
the catastrophe, portions of human bodies, the
débris of a lantern and Alpenstock, and the leaves
of a Latin book, were found imbedded in the
ice on the surface of the Glacier des Bossons and
near its foot. They were recognised as belonging
to the lost guides of Dr Hamel’s party. Further
discoveries were made in the two following years;
and of the relics thus brought to light, some are
preserved to this day by the Alpine Club in
their rooms at St Martin’s Place.</p>

<p>This accident afforded strong evidence in
favour of the fact of glacier motion, for the
remains were found to have been carried by the
ice a distance of nearly five miles from the spot
where the catastrophe occurred.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with the finding of the
relics of Dr Hamel’s ill-fated expedition, occurred
another accident on Mont Blanc. On August 9,
1864, a young porter named Ambroise Couttet,
while accompanying two Austrian gentlemen in
the ascent of Mont Blanc, fell into a crevasse on
the Grand Plateau. This was an accident attributable
entirely to carelessness, for it appears
that at the moment of the catastrophe Couttet
was walking apart from the others and quite
unattached. His companions did their best to
effect a rescue; but the crevasse was of such
great depth that they could not come near him.
A party of guides subsequently went out with
the object of recovering the body; but although
two of their number descended ninety feet into
the crevasse, they failed to reach it. It is
almost certain, from the terrible nature of the
fall, that the unfortunate man’s death must have
been instantaneous.</p>

<p>There were two sad accidents on Mont Blanc
in 1866. The precise cause of the first is somewhat
obscure, but the facts as far as they are
known are these. Sir George Young and his two
brothers, unaccompanied by guides, set out to
ascend Mont Blanc on August 23, and succeeded
in reaching the summit in safety. They had
not proceeded far in the descent, when, for some
reason unexplained, one of the party slipped and
dragged down the other two. They slid for a
short distance, then fell a height of twenty feet
or so, and were finally stopped by soft snow. Sir
George and his second brother escaped serious
injury; but the youngest brother, Mr Bulkeley
Young, was found to have broken his neck.</p>

<p>The accident to Captain Arkwright’s party was
of a different description, and in many respects
bears a close resemblance to that in which Dr
Hamel’s guides lost their lives. On the 13th of
October—unusually late in the year for such an
expedition—Captain Arkwright with one guide,
Michel Simond, and two porters, started from
the Grands Mulets to ascend Mont Blanc. At
a little distance they were followed by the landlord
of the <i>Pierre Pointue</i>, Silvain Couttet, and
a porter—these two having apparently come for
their own pleasure—on a separate rope. The
guides, probably by reason of its being a shorter
route, and, as such, likely to save time—an
important matter at that season of the year—chose
the route adopted by Dr Hamel’s party,
and which had come to be known by the name
of the Ancien Passage. They had almost reached
the spot where the disaster of 1820 occurred,
when the roar of an avalanche was heard.
Couttet and his companion, realising the danger,
fled for their lives. They were a little way
behind the others, and were so fortunate as to
escape; but Captain Arkwright and his guides
were caught by the avalanche and swept away.
This accident arose from precisely the same cause
as that which happened to Dr Hamel’s party—ignorance
of the state of the snow; but it differed
in one respect: whereas Dr Hamel’s party started
the avalanche, the avalanche which proved fatal
to Captain Arkwright and his guides fell from
above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">{515}</span></p>

<p>The fact of a second accident occurring at the
same place and from a similar cause, has given
to the Ancien Passage the reputation of being
essentially unsafe. It is not necessarily more
dangerous than other routes, and indeed it may
even be the safest route from Chamouni up Mont
Blanc. It is only really dangerous when the
snow is in bad order; and this is a point upon
which a guide is—or should be—competent to
give an opinion. On the day of the accident, the
snow was not in proper condition, and it was
because a right discretion was not used, that
Captain Arkwright and his companions lost their
lives.</p>

<p>We now come to an accident which ranks as
by far the most terrible which has ever happened
to Alpine climbers, for it resulted in the loss of
no fewer than eleven lives. On September 5,
1870, a party consisting of two American gentlemen,
Messrs Beane and Randall, and a Mr MacCorkendale,
with eight guides and porters—with
one exception, all Chamouni men—left Chamouni
with the intention of ascending Mont
Blanc. They passed the night at the Grands
Mulets, and next morning started for the summit.
Early in the afternoon, a violent storm burst
over Mont Blanc; and as the weather became
very bad and they did not return, it was resolved
to send out a search-party from Chamouni.
The weather, however, continued for some days
of such an unfavourable character that it was
not until the 17th, and when all hope had been
abandoned of finding any of the lost party alive,
that a discovery was made. The dead bodies of
Mr MacCorkendale and two of the porters were
first found. They were lying on the snow quite
uninjured, head uppermost, a little way above
the Mur de la Côte; and from the torn condition
of their clothes, it seemed probable that
they had slid some distance to the spot where
they were discovered. Higher up, lay the bodies
of Mr Beane and another porter, with the greater
portion of the baggage beside them. Of the
remaining six, no trace could be seen. A few
small articles which must have belonged to them
were picked up subsequently in the direction of
the Brenva Glacier; but that was all. To this
day their fate remains a mystery.</p>

<p>The only light thrown upon the catastrophe
was that which could be gathered from the pages
of a diary found on Mr Beane, and written by
him. Some doubt at first was cast upon the
authenticity of the entry, but there seems no
reason at all for disbelieving its genuineness.
What it told was as follows: ‘<i>Tuesday, September 6.</i>—I
have made the ascent of Mont Blanc with
ten persons—eight guides, Mr Corkendale, and Mr
Randall. We arrived at the summit at half-past
two o’clock. Immediately after leaving it, I was
enveloped in clouds of snow. We passed the
night in a grotto excavated out of the snow,
affording very uncomfortable shelter, and I was
ill all night. <i>September 7 (morning).</i>—Intense
cold, much snow, which falls uninterruptedly,
guides restless. <i>September 7 (evening).</i>—We have
been on Mont Blanc for two days in a terrible
snowstorm; we have lost our way, and are in
a hole scooped out of the snow, at a height of
fifteen thousand feet. I have no hope of descending.
Perhaps this book may be found and
forwarded.... We have no food; my feet
are already frozen, and I am exhausted; I have
only strength to write a few words. I die in the
faith of Jesus Christ, with affectionate thoughts
of my family; my remembrances to all. I trust
we may meet in heaven.’</p>

<p>The diary ended with instructions to his
family as to his private affairs.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that poor Mr Beane gives
us so little information of any practical value;
but meagre as his diary is, it sheds light on one
or two points. First, we gather that the party
actually reached the summit; and next, that it
was about half-past two in the afternoon, and
immediately after leaving it, that the storm
caught them. Now, how was it, we may fairly
ask, that so little progress was made on the
downward path?—for the ice-grotto of which Mr
Beane speaks was constructed at an altitude of
fifteen thousand feet, or only seven hundred and
eighty-one feet below the summit. How was
it that the guides failed completely to find a
way back over ground which they had traversed
so recently? Mr Beane does not tell us if any
attempts were made on the 6th and 7th to find
the way down—what little evidence we have
tends to prove that there were none—he merely
says, ‘We have lost our way.’ To sit down
and wait where they were, as they appear to
have done, showed a want of judgment which,
without being better acquainted than we are
with the facts of the case, seems quite inexplicable.
Nothing is more common in the high
Alps than to be overtaken by bad weather; but
out of the Chamouni district there has not been
an instance of a whole party perishing from
this special cause. It is difficult to avoid the
conclusion that the guides were not equal to
their task, that they lost their heads at the
very approach of danger, and gave themselves
up for lost at the moment when they should
have made the most determined effort to escape.</p>

<p>There was another circumstance, too, which
was held at the time to reflect somewhat upon
the conduct of the guides—not one of their
bodies was found. The five bodies recovered
were those of the <i>heaviest</i> members of the party,
and there can be little doubt that they must
have been left behind, while the rest made an
effort to save themselves. Mr Beane, however,
makes no mention of any division of the party,
and it is charitable to suppose that no division
actually took place until after the weaker members
had succumbed to the exposure. What led
to the division, will never be known; neither
will it be known what motive impelled the
guides to act in such an utterly incomprehensible
manner. That the leaders of the party <i>ought</i> to
have been thoroughly up to their work, is emphasised
by the fact, that neither Mr Beane, Mr
Randall, nor Mr MacCorkendale had had previous
experience of mountaineering, and were quite
incapable of giving advice of any practical value
when difficulties arose. As a matter of fact, it
does not appear that any one of the guides held
a foremost place in his profession. Judging by
their actions, they certainly proved themselves
singularly wanting in many of the most important
qualities of good guides; and it is impossible to
believe that they could have been other than
very second-rate. But should the blame of the
disaster be laid to their charge? Should it not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">{516}</span>
rather attach to a system which rendered such
an accident only too probable?</p>

<p>In the same year (1870) there was yet another
accident on Mont Blanc. A gentleman and two
ladies, accompanied by a guide and a porter,
were out on the mountain; and the gentleman
wishing to go further than the ladies cared to,
took the guide, and left them in charge of the
porter. With what object, it is not known, the
porter promptly proceeded to conduct his charges
across a snow-field which was well known to be
honeycombed with concealed crevasses. Under
these circumstances, it would have been only
wonderful if an accident had not occurred, and
unfortunately that took place which might have
been predicted. The porter had given his arm
to one of the ladies, and was leading her across,
when the snow gave way beneath them, and they
both fell headlong into a deep crevasse. Here
was a case of two lives wantonly sacrificed. That
any one calling himself a guide should have
shown such gross ignorance of the very first
principles of mountaineering as this porter did,
is almost inconceivable. It is perfectly clear that
he did not understand his business, and was certainly
not a fit person to have been sent on
expeditions above the snow-line.</p>

<p>A still later accident on Mont Blanc took
place on the south side. On the 30th August
1874, Mr J. A. G. Marshall, with two Oberland
guides, Johann Fischer and Ulrich Almer, left
Courmayeur with a view to attempting the ascent
of Mont Blanc by way of the Brouillard Glacier,
an ascent which had not at that time been effected.
They camped out upon the mountain at a height
of about ten thousand feet, and the following
day worked their way a considerable distance
upwards till they found themselves finally stopped
by an impassable wall of rock. This occurred
somewhat late in the afternoon, too late, indeed,
to attempt any other route, and accordingly they
turned back. The descent was difficult, and
night overtook them before they reached the
spot where they had bivouacked the previous
evening. They were crossing the last bit of
glacier, when Fischer inquired the time, and Mr
Marshall drew out his watch, while the others
came up to him with a light. As they stood
thus close together, the snow gave way beneath
them. Fischer fell first into a crevasse which
at this point was some thirty feet deep and five
feet in width; and Mr Marshall was dragged on
to him; while Almer alighted upon a hummock
of snow but a few feet below the mouth of the
crevasse. Mr Marshall’s head came in contact
with the side of the crevasse, and in his case,
death must have been instantaneous; while
Fischer’s injuries were of such a character that
he, too, could not have lived for any time after
the fall. Almer escaped with a severe shaking,
but was rendered insensible by the shock of the
fall. Upon coming to himself, he found that
both his companions were beyond help; and as
soon as there was sufficient light, he struggled
down to Courmayeur with the intelligence of
the accident. The dead bodies were recovered
the same evening, and brought back the next
day to Courmayeur.</p>

<p>Of all the accidents which have happened on
Mont Blanc, this was perhaps the one most
deserving the term. Mr Marshall and his guides
were first-rate mountaineers, and it was scarcely
from any fault of their own that the catastrophe
occurred. From a sketch of the spot taken by
M. Loppé the artist a few days after the occurrence,
the crevasse looks curiously narrow, and
if the party had only been standing but a few
paces to right or left, they would have been in
perfect safety. Moreover, the scene of the catastrophe
was not five minutes’ walk from the
moraine.</p>

<p>Thus Mont Blanc is responsible for the loss of no
fewer than twenty-four lives; but it is when we
compare him with other mountains that we realise
how much more fatal he has been than any of his
fellows. The following table, compiled from the
<i>Alpine Journal</i>, will best bring home this fact:</p>

<p>Single lives have been lost upon each of the
following mountains: Riffelhorn, Gross Venedeger,
Schreckhorn, Piz Tschierva, Diablerets,
Blumlis Alp, Piz Bernina, Grandes Jorasses, Meije.</p>

<p>Of accidents which may fairly come under the
head of Alpine accidents, such as accidents upon
glaciers and subsidiary peaks, there appear to
have been thirty-five—making a total loss since
1859, when climbing became a recognised form of
amusement, of ninety-eight lives, or, inclusive of
Dr Hamel’s accident, one hundred and one.
When we come to consider that Mont Blanc is
responsible for nearly one-fourth of the whole, we
may well question whether the depreciation of the
mountain is quite justified. Is it not rather a
case of underrating the enemy?</p>

<p>No reasonable person can deny that there is at
times danger on Mont Blanc, and when we consider
from what a variety of causes it may arise—from
weather, from the state of the snow, from
the unfitness of many of those who attempt the
ascent, and last, but not least, from the guide
system of Chamouni—we feel inclined to wonder
not, indeed, that the loss of life has been great,
but rather that the death-roll is not much
greater.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XL.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Even</span> as Delgado stood there still on the steps
of the piazza at Orange Grove, waving his
blood-stained cutlass fiercely about his head, and
setting his foot contemptuously on Mr Dupuy’s
prostrate and bleeding body, Harry Noel tore
up the path that led from Dick Castello’s house
at Savannah Garden, and halted suddenly in
blank amazement in front of the doorway—Harry
Noel, in evening dress, hatless and spurless;
just as he had risen in horror from his
dinner, and riding his new mare without even
a saddle, in his hot haste to see the cause of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">{517}</span>
the unexpected tumult at the Dupuys’ estate.
The fierce red glare of the burning cane-houses
had roused him unawares at Savannah Garden
in the midst of his coffee; and the cries of the
negroes and the sound of pistol-shots had cast
him into a frantic fever of anxiety for Nora’s
safety. ‘The niggers have risen, by Jove!’ Dick
Castello cried aloud, as the flames rose higher
and higher above the blazing cane-houses. ‘They
must be attacking old Dupuy; and if once their
blood’s up, you may depend upon it, Noel, they
won’t leave him until they’ve fairly murdered
him.’</p>

<p>Harry Noel didn’t wait a moment to hear
any further conjectures of his host’s on the subject,
but darting round to the stables bareheaded,
clapped a bit forthwith into his mare’s mouth,
jumped on her back just as she stood, in a
perfect frenzy of fear and excitement, and tore
along the narrow winding road that led by
tortuous stretches to Orange Grove as fast as
his frightened horse’s legs could possibly carry
him.</p>

<p>As he leaped eagerly from his mount to the
ground in the midst of all that hideous din and
uproar and mingled confusion, Delgado was just
calling on his fellow-blacks to follow him boldly
into the house and to ‘kill de missy;’ and the
Orange Grove negroes, cowed and terrified now
that their master had fallen bodily before them,
were beginning to drop back, trembling, into
the rooms behind, and allow the frantic and
triumphant rioters to have their own way unmolested.
In a moment, Harry took in the full
terror of the scene—saw Mr Dupuy’s body lying,
a mass of hacked and bleeding wounds, upon the
wooden floor of the front piazza; saw the infuriated
negroes pressing on eagerly with their cutlasses
lifted aloft, now fairly drunk with the
first taste of buckra blood; and Delgado in
front of them all, leaping wildly, and gesticulating
in frantic rage with arms and hands and
fingers, as he drove back the terrified servants
through the heavy old mahogany doorway of the
great drawing-room into the room that opened out
behind toward Nora’s own little sacred boudoir.</p>

<p>Harry had no weapon of any sort with him
except the frail riding-whip he carried in his
hand; but without waiting for a second, without
thinking for one instant of the surrounding
danger, he rushed up the piazza steps, pushed
the astonished rioters to right and left with his
powerful arms, jumped over the senseless planter’s
prostrate body, swept past Delgado into the
narrow doorway, and there stood confronting the
savage ringleader boldly, his little riding-whip
raised high above his proud head with a fierce
and threatening angry gesture. ‘Stop there!’ he
cried, in a voice of stern command, that even
in that supreme moment of passion and triumph
had its full effect upon the enraged negroes.
‘Stop there, you mean-spirited villains and
murderers! Not a step further—not a step
further, I tell you! Cowards, cowards, every
one of you, to kill a poor old man like that
upon his own staircase, and to threaten a helpless
innocent lady.’</p>

<p>As he spoke, he laid his hand heavily upon
Louis Delgado’s bony shoulder, and pushed the
old negro steadily backward, out of the doorway
and through the piazza, to the front steps,
where Mr Dupuy’s body was still lying untended
and bleeding profusely. ‘Stand back, Delgado!’
he cried out fiercely and authoritatively.
‘Stand back this minute, and put down your
cutlass! If you want to fight the whites, you
cowardly scoundrels you, why don’t you fight
the men like yourselves, openly and straightforward,
instead of coming by night, without note
or warning, burning and hacking and killing and
destroying, and waging war against defenceless
old men and women and children?’</p>

<p>The negroes fell back a little grudgingly, as
he spoke, and answered him only by the loud
and deep guttural cry—an inarticulate, horribly
inhuman gurgle—which is their sole possible
form of speech in the very paroxysm of African
passion. Louis Delgado held his cutlass half
doubtfully in his uplifted hand: he had tasted
blood once now; he had laid himself open to
the fierce vengeance of the English law; he
was sorely tempted in the whirlwind of the
moment to cut down Harry Noel too, as he
had cut down the white-headed old planter
the minute before. But the innate respect of
the essentially fighting negro for a resolute
opponent held him back deliberating for a
moment; and he drew down his cutlass as
quickly as he had raised it, divided in mind
whether to strike or to permit a parley.</p>

<p>Noel seized the occasion with intuitive
strategy. ‘Here you, my friends,’ he cried boldly,
turning round towards the cowering Orange Grove
servants—‘is this the way you defend your
master? Pick him up, some of you—pick him
up this minute, I tell you, and lay him out
decently on the sofa over yonder.—There, there;
don’t be afraid. Not one of these confounded
rogues and cowards dares to touch you or come
one pace nearer you as long as you’re doing
it. If he does! cutlass or no cutlass, I’ll break
this riding-whip to pieces, I tell you, across
his black head as soon as look at him.’ And
he brandished the whip angrily in front of
him, towards the mad and howling group of
angry rioters, held at bay for the moment on the
piazza steps by that solitary, undismayed, young
Englishman with his one frail and ridiculous
weapon.</p>

<p>The rioters howled all the louder at his words,
and leaped and grinned and chattered and gesticulated
like wild beasts behind an iron railing;
but not one of them ventured to be the first in
aiming a blow with his deadly implement at
Harry Noel. They only yelled once more incomprehensibly
in their deep gutturals, and made
hideous wild grimaces, and waved their cutlasses
frantically around them with horrible inarticulate
negro imprecations.</p>

<p>But Harry stood there firm and unyielding,
facing the maddened crowd with his imperious
manner, and overawing them in spite of themselves
with that strange power of a superior race
over the inferior in such critical moments of
intense passion.</p>

<p>The Orange Grove servants, having fresh
courage put into their failing breasts once more
by the inspiring presence of a white man at
their sides, and being true at heart to their poor
master, as negro house-servants always are and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">{518}</span>
always have been in the worst extremities, took
advantage of the momentary lull in the storm
to do as Harry told them, and lift Mr Dupuy’s
body up from the ground, laying it carefully on
the piazza sofa. ‘That’s better,’ Harry said, as
they finished their task.—‘Now, we must go on
and drive away these murderous rascals. If we
don’t drive them away, my good friends, they’ll
kill Miss Nora—they’ll kill Miss Nora. Would
you have it said of you that you let a parcel
of murderous plantation rioters kill your own
dead master’s daughter right before your very
faces?’</p>

<p>As he spoke, he saw a pale face, pale, not with
fear, but with terrible anger, standing mutely
and immovably beside him; and next moment
he heard Nora Dupuy’s voice crying out deeply,
in the very echo of his own angry words:
‘Cowards, cowards!’</p>

<p>At the sight of the hated Dupuy features, the
frenzied plantation hands seemed to work themselves
up into a fresh access of ungovernable fury.
With indescribable writhings and mouthings and
grimaces, their hatred and vengeance found articulate
voice for a moment at least, and they
cried aloud like one man: ‘Kill her—kill her!
Kill de missy! Kill her—kill her!’</p>

<p>‘Give me a pistol,’ Harry Noel exclaimed wildly
to the friendly negroes close behind his back:
‘a gun—a knife—a cutlass—anything!’</p>

<p>‘We got nuffin, sah,’ Uncle ’Zekiel answered,
blankly and whiningly, now helpless as a child
before the sudden inundation of armed rioters,
for without his master he could do nothing.</p>

<p>Harry looked around him desperately for a
moment, then, advancing a step with hasty premeditation,
he wrenched a cutlass suddenly by
an unexpected snatch from one of the foremost
batch of rioters, and stepped back with it once
more unhurt, as if by miracle, into the narrow
pass of the mahogany doorway.</p>

<p>‘Stand away, Miss Dupuy!’ he cried to her
earnestly. ‘If you value your life, stand back,
I beg of you. This is no place for you to-night.
Run, run! If you don’t escape, there’ll be more
murder done presently.’</p>

<p>‘I shall not go,’ Nora answered, clenching her
fist hard and knitting her brow sternly, ‘as long
as one of these abominable wretches dares to stop
without permission upon my father’s piazza.’</p>

<p>‘Then stand away, you there!’ Harry shouted
aloud to the surging mob; ‘stand away this
moment, every one of you! Whoever steps one
single step nearer this lady behind me, that step
shall be his last.’</p>

<p>Delgado stood still and hesitated once more,
with strange irresolution—he didn’t like to hit
the brown man—but Isaac Pourtalès, lifting his
cutlass wildly above his head, took a step in
front and brought it down with a fierce swish
towards Harry’s skull, in spite of kinship. Harry
parried it dexterously with his own cutlass, like
a man who has learned what fencing means;
and then, rushing, mad with rage, at the astonished
Isaac before he knew what to look for,
brought down a heavy blow upon his right
shoulder, that disabled his opponent forthwith,
and made him drop at once his useless weapon
idly by his side. ‘Take that, you nigger dog!’
Harry hissed out fiercely through his close-set
teeth; ‘and if any other confounded nigger
among you all dares to take a single step nearer
in the same direction, he’ll get as much and
more, too, than this insolent fellow here has got
for his trouble.’</p>

<p>The contemptuous phrase once more roused
all the negroes’ anger. ‘Who you call nigger,
den?’ they cried out fiercely, leaping in a body
like wild beasts upon him. ‘Kill him—kill him!
Him doan’t fit to lib. Kill him—kill him, dis
minute—kill him!’</p>

<p>But Delgado, some strange element of compassion
for the remote blood of his own race
still rising up instinctively and mysteriously
within him, held back the two or three foremost
among the pressing mass with his sinewy arm.
‘No, no, me fren’s,’ he shouted angrily, ‘doan’t
kill him, doan’t kill him. Tiger no eat tiger,
ole-time folk say; tiger no eat tiger. Him is
nigger himself. Him is Isaac Pourtalès’ own
cousin.—Doan’t kill him. His mudder doan’t
nobody, I tell you, me fren’s, but coloured gal,
de same as yours is—coloured gal from ole
Barbadoes. I sayin’ to you, me fren’s, ole-time
folk has true proverb, tiger no eat tiger.’</p>

<p>The sea of angry black faces swelled up and
down wildly and dubiously for a moment, and
then, with the sudden fitful changefulness of
negro emotion, two or three voices, the women’s
especially, called aloud, with sobs and shrieks:
‘Doan’t kill him!—doan’t kill him! Him me
brudder—him me brudder. Doan’t kill him!
Hallelujah!’</p>

<p>Harry looked at them savagely, with knit
brows and firm-set teeth, his cutlass poised ready
to strike in one hand, and his whole attitude
that of a forlorn-hope at bay against overwhelming
and irresistible numbers.</p>

<p>‘You black devils!’ he cried out fiercely,
flinging the words in their faces, as it were,
with a concentrated power of insult and hatred,
‘I won’t owe my life to that shameful plea.
Perhaps I may have a drop or two of your
black blood flowing somewhere in my veins,
and perhaps I mayn’t; but whether I have
or whether I haven’t, I wouldn’t for dear life
itself acknowledge kindred with such a pack of
cowardly vagabonds and murderers as you, who
would hack an old man brutally to death like
that, before his own daughter’s face, upon his
own staircase.’</p>

<p>‘Mr Noel,’ Nora echoed, in a clear defiant tone,
nothing trembling, from close behind him, ‘that
was well said—that was bravely spoken! Let
them come on and kill us if they will, the
wretches. We’re not afraid of them, we’re not
afraid of them.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Dupuy,’ Harry cried earnestly, looking
back towards her with a face of eager entreaty,
‘save yourself! for God’s sake, save yourself.
There’s still time even now to escape—by the
garden-gate—to Hawthorn’s—while these wretches
here are busy murdering me.’</p>

<p>At the word, Louis Delgado sprang forward
once more, cutlass in hand, no longer undecided,
and with one blow on the top of the head felled
Harry Noel heavily to the ground.</p>

<p>Nora shrieked, and fell fainting to the ground.</p>

<p>‘Him doan’t dead yet,’ Delgado yelled aloud
in devilish exultation, lifting his cutlass again
with savage persistence. ‘Hack him to pieces,
dar—hack him to pieces! Him doan’t dead yet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">{519}</span>
I tellin’ you, me fren’s. Hack him to pieces!
An’ when him dead, we gwine to carry him an’
de missy an’ Massa Dupuy out behind dar, an’
burn dem all in a pile togedder on de hot ashes
ob de smokin’ cane-house!’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="COUNTRY_JOTTINGS">COUNTRY JOTTINGS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> British Islands were formerly covered with
vast forests. Robber-bands at one time infested
the woods, of whom Robin Hood of Sherwood
Forest is the most noted. A continually increasing
population and the advancement of science
have changed the aspect; these places have now
become the abodes of peaceful, civilised, and
friendly men; the desert and impenetrable forest
are changed into marts of industry, cultivated
fields, rich gardens, and magnificent cities. The
towns and cities of the Britons were generally
built in valleys upon the margin of a stream or
river, for the convenience of water and security
from winds. Surrounded by impervious woods,
and secured by a rampart and fosse, they were sufficiently
strong to resist the ordinary attacks of
their enemies. The Roman soldiers were as much
accustomed to the use of the plough as the shield,
and were as industrious in peace as they were
brave in war. When they had fixed their camps,
they availed themselves of the advantages the
surrounding country presented, in order to secure
to themselves the necessary supplies. Woods were
cut down, the ground cleared and ploughed up;
and roads were constructed from station to
station, to facilitate the conveyance of goods,
and collect their forces together with more ease
and expedition on any sudden emergency. The
Roman custom of grazing in Italy was adopted
in the remotest parts of their widely extended
empire. The dry ground of the hills and the
moist meadows of the vale were successively the
pasture of their flocks and herds. During the
summer, they confined them to the marshes
and low grounds; and on the approach of
winter they drove them up to the hills. Our
Anglo-Saxon forefathers in the forests of oak and
beech reared large numbers of sheep and swine,
and in the rich pastures and open downs of the
south and west.</p>

<p>Uncivilised man, impelled rather by his wants
than allured by pleasure, ardently pursues the
beasts of the forest. Hunting may be considered
as his necessary employment, and the game caught
by his dexterity and cunning, as being the chief
part of his subsistence. This employment, toilsome
as it is, yields, however, but a precarious
and uncertain support; and when man has been
taught to supply his wants by the cultivation
of the ground, if it be not wholly relinquished,
it will only be pursued as an amusement or as
a healthful exercise. The ancient Britons lived
on milk and the produce of the chase. In the
present day, the Hottentot and Bushman partly
live on the larvæ of insects and the refuse of
animals killed by the colonists. In Australia
proper, some natives eat reptiles, and even insects
and vermin. The Oceanic negroes have no fixed
habitation, but they live in the hollows of trees
and rocks. Many of the inhabitants of the
Marquesas, Fiji, and other islands, are cannibals.
Among a tribe in Sumatra, criminals condemned
are eaten alive, each one, according to
his rank, taking that portion of flesh from the
living victim he prefers, and devouring it on the
spot either raw or cooked. Agriculture amongst
these tribes is in a very backward state, and
hunting is one of their principal means of
subsistence.</p>

<p>Ancient chronicles state that King Edgar
attempted to extirpate the wolves in England by
commuting the punishments for certain offences
into the acceptance of a certain number of wolves’
tongues from each criminal; and in Wales, by
converting the tax of gold and silver into an
annual tribute of three hundred wolves’ heads.
In subsequent times, their destruction was promoted
by certain rewards, and some lands were
held on condition of destroying the wolves
which infested the parts of the kingdom in which
they were situated. In 1281 these animals troubled
several of the English counties, but after
that period our records make no mention of
them. The last wolf known in Scotland was
killed in 1680; and in Ireland, one was killed
in 1701. Very fearful accounts are on record of
the ravages committed by wolves when in hard
weather they associate in immense flocks. So
lately as 1760, such terror is said to have been
excited in France by ravages of wolves that
public prayers were offered for their destruction.
Since India became so much the country of
Europeans, the race of tigers has been much
thinned, and ere long it is probable that they
will be driven to the most remote and impenetrable
districts.</p>

<p>The wolf in these islands was hunted by an
animal known under various appellations, as the
Irish wolf-dog, the Irish greyhound, the Highland
deerhound, and the Scotch greyhound. There
appears to be no doubt that all the dogs thus
denominated were essentially of the same breed.
Its original home is supposed to have been Ireland,
whence, during the proud days of ancient
Rome, it was frequently conveyed in iron cages
to assist in the sports of the city on the Tiber.
Buffon observes: ‘The Irish greyhounds are of
a very ancient race, and still exist (though their
number is small) in their original climate; they
were called by the ancients, dogs of Epirus and
Albanian dogs.’ Holinshed, in his <i>Description
of Ireland and the Irish</i>, written in 1586, says:
‘They are not without wolves and greyhounds
to hunt them, bigger of bone and limb than
a colt.’ In Anglo-Saxon times, a nobleman never
went out unaccompanied by some of these dogs
and his hawk; and so highly were they esteemed,
that by the forest laws of Canute it was ordered
that no person under the rank of a gentleman
should keep one.</p>

<p>Until after the Norman Conquest, the chase
was always, even in England, pursued on foot;
the nobles of the Conqueror’s train introduced
the custom of hunting on horseback. As cultivation
increased, and the most formidable objects
of chase, the wolves, decreased in England, the
breed degenerated in size and strength; whilst
the quality now more desiderated, speed, was, on
the other hand, still more strongly developed.
The result is the present race of greyhounds.
In Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, the rugged
character of the country kept up for a much
longer time the ancient deer-hunts in all their
essential features. Boar-hunting, ages ago, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">{520}</span>
practised in England. Fitzstephen, in his description
of England, written in the reign of
Henry II., in the latter part of the twelfth
century, states that the forest by which London
was then surrounded was frequented by boars
as well as various other wild animals. In Scotland,
a tract of country now forming one of the
extremities of the county of Fife, was anciently
called Muckross, which in Celtic signifies the
Boar-promontory. The tradition is that it was
a famous haunt of boars. A district forming
a portion of the same country, designated by the
name of the Boar Hills, lies in the vicinity of St
Andrews, in the cathedral church of which city it
is said that there were to be seen before the Reformation,
attached by a chain to the high-altar,
two boars’ tusks of the extraordinary length of
sixteen inches each, the memorials of an enormous
specimen which had been slaughtered by
the inhabitants after having long infested the
neighbourhood. The wild-boar was undoubtedly
an inhabitant of these islands, as mention is
made of it in the laws of Hoel-Dda, a celebrated
Welsh legislator, who permitted his grand-huntsman
to chase that animal from the middle
of November to the beginning of December.
William the Conqueror punished with loss of
life such as were guilty of killing the wild-boar.</p>

<p>Some remarkable occurrences have taken place
with regard to the tame kinds. A gamekeeper
actually educated a black sow to find game. Slut,
the name he gave her, was rendered as staunch
as any pointer. This pig-pointer was sold by
auction for a very large sum of money. A gentleman
had a sow which was taught to hunt, quarter
the ground, and to back the other pointers. As
a reward for her labours, the keeper carried
bread in his pocket. In the island of Minorca,
hogs are converted into beasts of draught; a cow,
a sow, and two young horses have been seen
yoked together, and of the four, the cow drew
the least.</p>

<p>Nothing can more strongly establish the passionate
devotion of the Normans to the sports
of the field than the conduct of the Conqueror
who laid waste the county of Hampshire and
made it a forest for wild beasts. The nobles,
like their leader, within their domains inclosed
extensive districts to preserve the <i>feræ naturæ</i>,
to afford them the pleasures of the chase. Parks
have been defined forests inclosed, and were called
<i>haiæ dominicales</i>. This word <i>haiæ</i> appears in
the composition of a variety of English local
names under the dialectical difference of <i>hey</i>,
<i>hay</i>, <i>how</i>, <i>haigh</i>. It is the Saxon <i>haeg</i>, and means
a hedge. To our royal and baronial castles
usually belonged two parks—one inclosed with
a wall for fallow-deer, and the other for red-deer,
fenced around with a hedge. Free warren
was a franchise granted for preservation or
custody of beasts and fowls of warren, which,
being <i>feræ naturæ</i>, every one had a right to kill
as he could; but upon the introduction of the
Forest Laws at the Norman Conquest, these
animals being looked upon as royal game and
the sole property of our savage monarchs, this
franchise of free warren was invented to protect
them, by giving the grantee a sole and exclusive
power of killing such game as far as his warren
extended, on condition of his preventing other
persons. Nanwood informs us that the hare, the
cony, the pheasant, and the partridge were beasts
and fowls of warren and no other. Sir Edward
Coke mentions as beasts and fowls of warren,
roes, rails, and quails, woodcocks, mallards, and
herons. Free warren gave to the lord of a
manor an exclusive right to hunt and kill the
game therein.</p>

<p>An attempt was made some years ago to introduce
the reindeer upon an extensive scale into
the colder parts of England and Scotland. Those
that were turned out upon the Pentland Hills,
near Edinburgh—a situation which was considered
peculiarly favourable—all died. A few appeared
to do well in a park near Dublin, but then
died. The Duke of Athole had previously placed
a herd of reindeer in the mountains of his
estate; but the experiment failed. Several fine
species of the wapiti, an American deer, were
turned into Windsor park some years ago: none
of them lived more than a year. The migratory
disposition of those animals is perhaps the reason
of their not thriving in any inclosed country.</p>

<p>The timber of our woods in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth was plentiful, nor did the navy, the
pride of Britain, consume one-thousandth part of
the timber which was found requisite. Though
the country is now shorn of its stately oaks, other
countries are ready to cut down their forests and
exchange them for British industry. Ireland was
formerly called the Island of Woods, and the
trunks of large trees are still found in the bogs.
A vast quantity of timber is exported from Germany.
In some parts of Austria, peat is used as
fuel, wood being scarce; yet the mountains of
Transylvania and the neighbouring south countries
abound in extensive forests. Such is the abundance
of oak, that above two hundred thousand
bushels of oak-apples are exported annually. The
forests of Greece are considerable. The quantity
of timber sent from Norway and Sweden
is very great. The resources of Russia lie in
its immense forests, its mines, and the fertility
of its soil. Some of the gum-trees of Tasmania
are three hundred and fifty feet high.
The baobab of Africa is said to live five thousand
years, and one trunk has measured one hundred
and four feet in circumference. So thick and
uninterrupted are the forests which cover the
plains of South America between the Orinoco
and the Amazon, that were it not for intervening
rivers, the monkeys, almost the only inhabitants,
might pass along the tops of the trees for
several hundred miles without touching the earth.
Sir Francis Head says that the backwoods of
North America are being cleared in the following
way. The mosquitoes torment the bisons and
other wild animals to such an intolerable degree
that they run with eagerness into any smoke
they can reach, as their little tormentors will
not follow them there. The Indians, then, instead
of hunting for game, set fire to the forests;
this brings the animals about them, and they
are easily shot. This is favourable to the white
agriculturist, but destructive to the poor Indian,
at least as long as he continues a mere hunter.</p>

<p>In British North America, the felling and
removing of timber for exportation is an important
employment. This is known as the lumber-trade,
and those engaged in it are called
lumberers. In Danish America, the inhabitants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">{521}</span>
are supplied with wood for fuel by the drift-timber
brought to the coasts by the currents.
Brazil may be regarded as a vast forest—the
forests are so extensive that they can hardly
be penetrated even with the help of fire and
the hatchet. In these vast solitudes, sometimes
a death-like silence reigns; at other times are
heard the howling of herds of monkeys, the
screams of parrots and toucans, with the buzzing
of the bee-like humming-bird, which the Brazilians
prettily call the ‘Kiss the Flower.’ The
New Holland lily grows to the height of twenty-four
feet; and in the Argentine Republic there
are immense numbers of thistles, ten or twelve
feet high, which form an impenetrable barrier,
whilst they last, to the attacks of the Indians.</p>

<p>The wild animals of England are now few in
number. At Chillingworth Park, in Northumberland,
there are some wild oxen. Had the fox
not been preserved for the chase, it would long
ago have been extinct. Dogs have a strong repugnance
to the wolf, but delight in the chase of
the fox. In cold countries, foxes are of various
colours. Red foxes are so abundant in the
wooded districts of the fur countries, that many
thousand skins are annually exported from America
to Britain. The fur of the black fox is
highly valued. While the writer was engaged
upon this article, the following circumstance came
under his notice. On the Alveston Hill estate,
near Stratford-on-Avon, a litter of eleven foxes,
apparently about six weeks old, all tame and
docile, have taken possession of a rabbit-hole
in a bank at the foot of a clump of trees. The
young cubs, notwithstanding the presence of
numerous people attracted to the spot by the
novel sight, leave their hole and drink occasionally
out of a trough containing milk which had
been placed there for their use. The animals are
as tame as puppies, and the visitors easily induce
them to come forth by whistling softly and calling
them. They are content to be picked up and
caressed, and they play about in the most amusing
manner. An artist has been to the spot and
photographed the whole group. It is thought
that the dog-fox has been killed, and that the
vixen has carried her cubs to the place mentioned.
In corroboration of this, it may be stated that
when first discovered, only four or five cubs were
to be seen, and they have gradually increased
until the present number has been reached.</p>

<p>The wild-cat finds its retreat among the mountains
of Scotland and of the northern counties
of England and of Wales and Ireland, the larger
woods being its place of concealment. It has
been called the ‘British Tiger.’ One was killed
in Cumberland which measured five feet from the
nose to the end of the tail. When Christopher
Columbus discovered America, a hunter brought
him one which he had found in the woods.
The hedgehog has been said to be proof against
poison. A German physician who wished to dissect
one, gave it prussic acid; but it took no
effect, neither did arsenic, opium, nor corrosive
sublimate. It has been found to eat a hundred
cantharides without injury. Plutarch mentions
the case of a man who discovered that a hedgehog
generally has its burrow open at various
points, and warned by an instinct of atmospheric
change, stopped up the opening next the quarter
whence the wind would blow, and thus could
predict to a certainty to which quarter the wind
would shift. Moles show changes of weather.
The temperature or dryness of the air governs
that underground worker in its motions as
to the depth at which it lives or works;
though this unquestionably is partly due, no
doubt, to its want of food or inability to bear
cold or thirst. The weasel has been known to
become domesticated. The method adopted to
obtain this end is to stroke them gently over the
back, and to threaten or beat them when they
attempt to bite. It has been found that when
their teeth have been rubbed with garlic, all
inclination to bite has been removed. Their
bite is generally fatal: a hare or rabbit once
severely bitten never recovers. Buffon gives the
case of a weasel being found with three young
ones in the carcase of a wolf that was grown
putrid, and that had been hung up by the hind-legs
as a terror to others. In this strange and
horrid retreat, the weasel had retired to bring
forth her young; she had furnished the cavity
with hay, grass, and leaves; and the young ones
were just brought forth when they were discovered
by a peasant passing that way.</p>

<p>The stoat of the continent is a very precious
article of commerce. In Britain, their skin is
of little value. In July 1827, a gentleman of
Cathcart, near Glasgow, having shot and wounded
a stoat, observed that it escaped into the hole of
an old stone wall. He was led to make an
examination of the place, when he found a couple
of leverets immolated. The place also contained
two young partridges entire, and a pheasant’s egg
unbroken. Besides these were two other leverets
in a state of putrefaction; and at the extremity
of the retreat lay the dead stoat. Naturalists
state that stoats seldom eat their plunder until
putrefaction sets in; and this fact would seem
to bear out the impression. The polecat is
very destructive to game. During a severe
storm, one of these animals was traced in the
snow from the side of a rivulet to a hole at some
distance from it. As it was observed to have
made frequent trips, and as other marks were
to be seen in the snow which could not easily
be accounted for, it was thought a matter worthy
of greater attention. Its hole was accordingly
examined, the polecat taken; and eleven eels
were discovered to be the fruit of its nocturnal
excursions. The marks in the snow were found
to have been made by the motion of the eels
in the creature’s mouth.</p>

<p>It is a curious circumstance that many of those
oaks which are called spontaneous are planted
by the squirrel. This little animal has performed
an essential service to the British navy. A
gentleman walking one day in the woods belonging
to the Duke of Beaufort, in the county
of Monmouth, his attention was diverted by a
squirrel, which sat very composedly upon the
ground. He stopped to perceive its motions.
In a few minutes the animal darted to the top
of a tree beneath which he had been sitting; in
an instant it was down with an acorn in its
mouth, and after digging a small hole, it deposited
the acorn; then covering it, it darted up the
tree again. In a moment it was down again with
another, which it buried in the same manner.
This it continued to do as long as the gentleman
watched it. The industry of this animal is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">{522}</span>
directed to the purpose of securing itself against
want in the winter; and it is probable that its
memory is not sufficiently retentive to enable
it to remember the spot in which it deposited
every acorn; the industrious little fellow no
doubt loses a few every year. These few spring
up, and are destined to supply the place of the
parent tree.</p>

<p>Asses, like horses, are found in a wild state,
but in greater abundance. This animal is found
wild in many islands of the Archipelago, and in
the deserts of Libya and Numidia. They live
in herds, each having a chief, and are extremely
timid. The ass, so common now in England,
was entirely lost in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.
Holinshed says that our land yielded no asses.
In early times the ass was held in high repute,
for he was ridden both by the poor and the rich,
and is frequently mentioned in the Scriptures.
In the principal streets of Cairo, asses stand
bridled and saddled for hire, and answer the
same purpose as cabs in London. In Egypt
and Arabia, asses are frequently seen of great
size and elegance. Their step is light and sure,
and their pace brisk and easy. They are not
only in common use for riding in Egypt, but
the Mohammedan merchants and ladies of the
highest rank use them. In England, the ass
is regarded as a stupid and contemptible animal.
The Spaniards, on the contrary, bestow much
pains upon him in endeavouring to improve the
breed.</p>

</div>


<h3>CHAPTER II.—WORSE AND WORSE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Major fervently wished that the ground
would open and swallow him. Here was a third
lady to pacify and to convince that a mistake
had been made. He could see that she was in
a more exasperated state even than Mrs Joseph,
and likely to be as blind as Mrs John. The
complication was becoming utterly bewildering,
and he felt that his brain would not endure
much more of it. How could such simple letters
as his—made studiously cautious in their statements—evoke
such wildly erroneous interpretations?
He would rather have faced a whole
battalion of mutinous Sikhs or infuriated Afghans
than have had to go through the inevitable
interview with this beautiful girl.</p>

<p>As soon as she reached the Major’s side, she
clutched his arm as if it were that of her
natural protector, and turned sharply upon
Maynard: ‘Now, sir, will you leave me alone?
Major Dawkins will conduct me to my aunt,
and will, if necessary, protect me from your
importunities.’</p>

<p>‘But Nelly, I only want to know what is my
fault? How have I given you cause for treating
me in this way?’ pleaded Maynard. ‘I am
positive that none can exist except in your own
imagination. I am sure the Major will tell you
that it is not fair to condemn a man without
hearing his defence—without even telling him
what he is accused of.’</p>

<p>‘If you are a gentleman, you will defer further
discussion of the subject until you see my aunt,
Mrs Joseph Elliott.’</p>

<p>Had they been alone, the lover would doubtless
have acted differently; but to have such words
addressed to him in the presence of another man
left no alternative. He bowed and retired, hurt
and angered by this injustice of his betrothed.
Whatever her reason for this outburst might
be, he was resolved that it should be promptly
explained. He was a straightforward young
fellow, and not one to rest for a moment in doubt
as to the meaning of her conduct.</p>

<p>The brief scene had closed before the Major
could find his voice. ‘Call him back,’ he said
agitatedly—‘call him back before it is too late.’</p>

<p>‘I certainly will not,’ replied the lady with
a movement of the head as if about to look
behind, suggesting that she half-hoped to see him
still following. But he was not.</p>

<p>‘Then I must. I cannot allow you to distress
yourself and a fine fellow like that in consequence
of my blunder.’</p>

<p>She stopped and faced him with an expression
of supercilious wonder. By this little movement
she could look without appearing to turn for the
purpose of looking whether or not Maynard had
really obeyed her. ‘I do not understand you,
Major Dawkins,’ she said with a faint note of
chagrin in her musical voice—for Maynard really
was not in sight.</p>

<p>‘Of course you cannot. How could you? The
letter you have got was not meant for you. I
wrote it to another lady, and I beg you to give
it back to me, so that no further mischief may
come of it.’</p>

<p>‘Another lady! Then I am <i>not</i> the <i>only</i> one
he thinks of?’ (She was quoting from the letter.)—‘Oh,
Major Dawkins, this is too much. Please,
let me go to the house, and do not say another
word about it until I have had time to recover
and to think.’</p>

<p>The Major stood aghast; he had put his foot
in it again. ‘But you are taking me up in quite
a wrong way. Certainly you are the only one
Maynard thinks of; but he is not the man
referred to in the letter. Do give it back to
me; and when you are calmer, everything will
be explained.’</p>

<p>He pleaded very earnestly; but his object was
defeated by the ingenuity on which he had congratulated
himself. He had mentioned no names
in any of the epistles. The mind of each lady
on reading the one she received naturally fastened
upon the man in whom she was most interested,
and the Major’s excited attempts at explanation
failed to make the error clear to them. Their
unreasonableness was painful to him; and if he
had been less anxious about remedying his error,
he would have laughed at it.</p>

<p>‘For whom, then, was the letter written?’ asked
Nellie, her indignation now turning against the
Major, as she reflected how cruel and how foolish
Stanley Maynard would think her if she had
accused him of falsehood on no other ground
than that she had received a misdirected letter
from a friend. ‘I must insist upon an answer.’</p>

<p>‘You really must not insist upon my telling
you. I accept all the blame; and it would be
another wicked blunder on my part to give you
my friend’s name.’</p>

<p>‘In that case, I must decline to return the
letter until we are in the presence of my aunt
and Mr Maynard.—Meanwhile, I need not trouble
you to escort me to the house.’ Nellie walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">{523}</span>
proudly away; but the poor girl was ready to
cry with vexation and with regret for the hastiness
of temper which had characterised her conduct
towards Stanley Maynard. In the moment
of repentance, however, came the remembrance
of the words which had distracted her. ‘I want
to save you’ (wrote the Major) ‘from a grave
misunderstanding.’ (‘Very kind indeed,’ she
interjected.) ‘He who is, I know, dearest to you,
thinks <i>only</i> of you. Consider his impulsive
nature, and pardon his temporary aberration.’
(‘What could that mean, if not that he had been
making love to somebody else?’ she asked
bitterly. Had she not herself seen how barefacedly
he flirted with Mrs John, until she had
a tiff with him on the subject? If he could
dare so much before her eyes, what might he
not do when unchecked by her presence?) ‘Be
merciful to him,’ the note proceeded, ‘as hitherto,
and you will have your reward. I mean to
take the first available opportunity of talking
to him after my arrival at Todhurst, and am
confident that he will be promptly brought to
reason.’</p>

<p>Was not that enough to rouse the spirit of
any girl who had proper pride, which means
self-respect? Nellie thought in her anger that
it was more than enough. No doubt the Major
had talked to him, and having brought him to
reason, was now anxious to screen him by telling
her that it was all a mistake—that the letter
had been intended for somebody else! But she
was frightened by this conclusion. Surely the
Major could not tell a deliberate falsehood! He
might not have meant to do so, and yet do it
in the excitement of the moment, in order to
soothe her. That must be the way of it; and
what an indignity that it should be necessary
for a friend to plead for her with the man to
whom she had promised her hand!</p>

<p>Her thoughts alternated between the hope that
it was all a mistake and the fear that it was
not. So she went to her room, cried, had a
headache, and excused herself from joining the
family at luncheon.</p>

<p>The Major was out of breath and out of patience
as he gazed helplessly after the retreating form
of Nellie Carroll. Nobody would listen to him;
everybody seemed determined to believe that he
had entered into a diabolic conspiracy to wreck
the happiness of the house of Elliott. What on
earth could there be in any of his letters to cause
such a commotion, even when they had got into
the wrong hands? He had assured every one
that there was only a misunderstanding, and he
had promised all round to set it right. But they
would not give him a chance. He had a good
mind to order Hollis to pack up for the next
train to London. That, however, would be
cowardly, and he was not a coward. He would
see the thing out to the bitter end. He lifted
his head with an air of resolution, and the bitter
end he saw at that moment was represented by
the wealthy spinster, Miss Euphemia Panton.
She was standing at a little distance, glaring at
him severely through her gold-rimmed <i>pince-nez</i>.
The Major had reason to believe that he had
found favour in her eyes, and he thought with
intense relief: ‘Well, here is somebody at last
who will give me a word of sympathy, and talk
sensibly with me.’</p>

<p>She, too, had reason to believe that she had
found favour in the Major’s eyes, and was pleased
accordingly. But on the present occasion, as he
tripped hopefully towards her (he tripped somewhat
less gracefully than usual, on account of
his recent excessive exercise), she made no responsive
movement; the <i>pince-nez</i> was not lowered,
and the severe expression remained. She had
been observing him pleading with all the ardour
of a lover to Miss Carroll; and she had no
doubt whatever of the meaning of his evidently
eager speech: he was in love with the minx,
and he had been only pretending to care for
Miss Euphemia! No lady can submit to be
trifled with in matters of affection, and least of
all ladies who have arrived at what may be called
the ‘undiscovered decade’ in feminine history.
She had passed into that realm of mystery, and
was indeed one of its oldest inhabitants; and
when nature would have lifted her out of it
into the peaceful land of resigned old-maidenism,
she sought the aid of art in order to keep her
place in the still hopeful region. She availed
herself of the modern elixirs of youth, and flattered
herself that she did so with complete success.
She, at their first meeting, noted that the Major
trafficked with the same beneficent powers. He
on his side made a similar observation regarding
her. Strange to say, this fact constituted a
bond of sympathy between them; but Miss
Euphemia believed that the Major was unaware
of her secret, and he was satisfied that she had
no suspicion of his; whilst each pitied the other
for not being more expert in the use of dyes
and cosmetics. Thus they became special friends,
and found so much pleasure in each other’s
society, that a matrimonial climax seemed not
improbable, the lady having a sufficient dowry
to dispose satisfactorily of the important problem
of ways and means.</p>

<p>‘Thank goodness, you are here, Miss Panton,’
exclaimed the Major in the full confidence of
her sympathy in his miserable position. ‘I have
got myself into a most abominable mess by an
act of stupidity which, although reprehensible,
is excusable.’</p>

<p>The lady answered not a word. She was nearly
a head taller than he, and she continued to
survey him through her glasses as if he had been
some zoological specimen.</p>

<p>He had been hot enough before; he was chilled
to the marrow now. He could scarcely believe
his senses. Would she, too, desert him in this
crisis?</p>

<p>‘Miss Panton,’ he stammered, ‘I hoped—that
is, I believed that you would show me some
consideration. I suppose Mrs Joseph has been
speaking to you; but if you will only listen
to a few words of explanation, you will understand
me.’</p>

<p>‘I think, Major Dawkins, I have to-day observed
enough on the tennis-lawn and here, to enable
me to understand you perfectly without Mrs
Joseph Elliott’s assistance or yours.’ The words
were icicles. She dropped her <i>pince-nez</i> and
walked away.</p>

<p>The Major was speechless. He trembled or
shivered with dismay. Lifting a hand to his
brow, he felt the heads of cold perspiration on
it, and at the same moment the gong sounded
for luncheon. Good heavens! Horrible idea!—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">{524}</span>
effect of all this excitement and perspiration
must be to change the colour of his hair!
And true enough it was beginning to show a
marked shade of gray-green at the roots. He
<i>must</i> get to his room to repair the damage
before he appeared at the luncheon table.
‘Desperate ills need desperate remedies.’</p>

<p>Luncheon at Todhurst was, except in the
hunting season, like the family gathering of
other days, when the mid-day meal was the
chief one. There were blithe interchanges of
the morning’s experiences, pleasant intercourse
with some of the elder members of the nursery,
and a homely ease which was not always found
at the late dinner, when formal company-manners
had to be assumed, so far as they could be in
the genial presence of Squire Elliott. All this
was changed on the fatal day on which the
Major’s misdirected letters had been delivered.
The Squire sat at one end of the table, evidently
in an ill-humour; his spouse, Mrs Joseph, at
the other end, doing her best not to show the
wrath which was in her bosom. Mrs John was
suppressing her natural gaiety and desire to make
fun of the whole party, whilst she was pathetically
earnest in her endeavours to soothe the
perturbed spirit of her lord. The latter was
irritable and gloomy, accepting her attentions
most ungraciously. Stanley Maynard ate and
looked as if he were savagely devouring an enemy.
Miss Euphemia sat like a post, playing with her
knife and fork rather than eating. Nellie was
not present.</p>

<p>The Major was late in taking his place, and
was flustered in consequence, even more than
he might have been under the circumstances.
He felt the gloom which pervaded the place,
and he was made painfully conscious of the fact
that he was the cause of it. He was generally
regarded as an acquisition to any party, for he
had a special knack of setting conversations
‘going,’ a more useful quality than that which
constitutes a ‘good talker.’ The latter demands
everybody’s attention, and bores the greater part
of his audience; the former enables everybody
to speak, and thus produces the agreeable feeling
of self-satisfaction in having personally contributed
to the enjoyment of the hour.</p>

<p>With desperate heroism, he endeavoured to
break the spell which tied the tongues of his
companions. He told one of his best stories,
the point of which had never failed to set the
table in a roar of laughter. Lugubrious grimaces
were the only response. He tried another anecdote,
with the same result. He descended to
the lowest depths of convivial intercourse; he
propounded a conundrum, and the eldest of the
girls immediately answered it with the addition
of the galling commentary: ‘I knew that long
ago.’ In his present condition of absolute helplessness,
he wished to goodness the child would
remember another conundrum, and give it for
his benefit, if not for that of the company.
Probably, she would have done so, had not the
mother’s eye been upon her, suggesting the austere
maxim, ‘Children should be seen, not heard.’</p>

<p>The Major took another tack. He put questions
to his host about the moors, about the
horses, about the hounds, and about the cause
of <i>Tally-ho’s</i> illness—any one of which topics
would at another time have started the Squire
into a gallop of chat. He would have compared
the seasons as affecting the moors for twenty
years past; he would have detailed the pedigree
and merits of every horse in his stables; he
would have repeated endless anecdotes about the
hounds; and as to the illness of <i>Tally-ho</i>, he
would have gone into the most minute particulars
as to its cause, his treatment, and the probable
result.</p>

<p>But on this day all was in vain. The Major’s
suggestive queries were responded to by: ‘Don’t
know,’ ‘Much the same as usual,’ ‘Hope for the
best,’ and, ‘I daresay the brute will come round.’</p>

<p>When they rose from the table, the Major
thanked heaven that this trial was over. The
Squire, with a curious mingling of awkwardness
and suppressed ill-temper, utterly opposed to his
habitually jovial manner, advanced to his unhappy
guest: ‘I want to see you in the library in
about half an hour,’ he said, and walked out
of the room.</p>

<p>‘That’s a comfort,’ thought the Major. ‘I
shall have a man with some common-sense to
hear me.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he would have liked to speak a
few words of consolation to Maynard; but that
gentleman met his advances with somewhat
repellent politeness.</p>

<p>‘If you want to speak to me about the trouble
you have made between Miss Carroll and me,
you will have ample opportunity to do so when
we meet in the library,’ he said, and strolled out
to the lawn to seek the soothing influence of a
cigar.</p>

<p>Then the Major wished to discharge the duty
he had so rashly undertaken, which was to bring
the morbidly suspicious John Elliott to reason.
He was only now realising the difficulty of the
task; and he presently had a decisive indication
that it was likely to be one he could not accomplish.
He had barely uttered half-a-dozen words
of his well-intentioned admonition which was to
precede his explanation of ‘the incident,’ when
John Elliott peevishly interrupted him: ‘I have
promised not to discuss this subject until we are
in the library.’</p>

<p>So, he was to meet the three of them. So
much the better; they were men, and they
would give him a patient hearing. Still, he
would have liked a little private talk with John
Elliott before the meeting in the library, which
was assuming the character of a sort of court-martial.
There were things to say to him which
could only be uttered when they were conversing
confidentially. For instance, he could not
say to him before others: ‘You have been accusing
Mrs John of behaviour unbecoming your
wife; you have magnified the circumstance of
her allowing young Maynard to kiss her under
the mistletoe last Christmas, until you have come
to believe that every time she says a friendly
word to him or smiles on him, she is false to
you. You have even gone so far as to think
of employing a private detective to watch them.
Now, my dear friend, do get all that confounded
nonsense out of your head. Remember that she
has known Maynard from his boyhood; and
although she is not old enough to be his mother,
she still looks on him as a boy, and he regards
her as an elder sister. She is naturally frank,
and naturally treats him with more frankness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">{525}</span>
than she does other men. You know that she
long ago set her heart upon making a match
between him and Nellie Carroll, both being
suitable in every respect; and she has succeeded.
What do you think will happen if your absurd
fancies get wind? Why, there will be a general
rupture—a split in the camp which may separate
the young folk, and, possibly, you and Mrs John,
who has been and is devoted to you.’</p>

<p>There, that would have brought him to reason,
if he had a scrap of sense left. But it could not
be spoken in the presence of others. Very likely,
suspicious John would ask him how he came to
know all this, and the question would be troublesome—a
thousand times more troublesome since
all the letters had got into the wrong hands.
The one for John Elliott had reached Mrs Joseph,
instead of the simple intimation of the date of
the Major’s arrival; that for Nellie had been
delivered to Mrs John, and Mrs John’s to Nellie.
It was awkward.</p>

<p>‘As to the question,’ the Major reflected: ‘I
got the information from Matt Willis, the brother
of Mrs John; and he made me promise not to
mix him up in the affair. He got the information
from John Elliott himself, who complained
to his brother-in-law about the way his wife
was carrying on with Maynard. Matt had an
unconquerable antipathy to family squabbles,
and would not interfere; but thinking that
something should be done to shut John up
before serious harm came of his insane suspicions,
he asked me, as the friend of the family,
to put things right. Like a fool, I consented;
and the blame of all the trouble falls on me!
Am I to blame?—Stop a minute. By Jove!—it
is John Elliott who is the author of the whole
mischief, and I’ll tell him so.’</p>

<p>Greatly consoled by the discovery that he was
not the original culprit in causing what promised
to be a serious breach in the relationships of
valued friends, the Major was prepared to face
the court-martial before which he was presently
to stand. Ay, and he would have no nonsense
about the affair. He would tell Squire Joseph
bluntly that Mrs Joseph had taken possession
of a letter which did not belong to her. He
would tell Maynard to go and speak to Nellie,
and assure her, as he had done, that she had
misinterpreted the letter she had received, even
if it had been intended for her; and he would
tell John Elliott that he must either speak to
him in private, or take the consequence of his
speaking in the presence of the Squire and
Stanley Maynard.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="AN_OLD_TULIP_GARDEN">AN OLD TULIP GARDEN.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A quiet</span>, sunny nook in the hollow it is, this
square old garden, with its gravelled walks and
high stone walls; a sheltered retreat left peaceful
here, under the overhanging woods, when the
stream of the world’s traffic turned off into another
channel. The gray stone house, separated from
the garden by a thick privet hedge and moss-grown
court, is the last dwelling at this end of
the quiet market-town, and, with its slate roof
and substantial double story, is of a class greatly
superior to its neighbours, whose warm red tiles
are just visible over the walls. It stands where
the old road to Edinburgh dipped to cross a little
stream, and, in the bygone driving days, the stagecoach,
after rattling out of the town and down the
steep road there, between the white, tile-roofed
houses, when it crossed the bridge opposite the
door, began to ascend through deep, embowering
woods. But a more direct highway to the Scottish
metropolis was opened many a year ago:
just beyond the bridge, a wall was built across
the road; and the gray house with its garden was
left secluded in the sunny hollow. The rapid
crescendo of the coach-guard’s horn no longer
wakens the echoes of the place, and the striking
of the clock every hour in the town steeple is
the only sound that reaches the spot from the
outside world.</p>

<p>The hot sun beats on the garden here all day,
from the hour in the morning when it gets above
the grand old beeches of the wood, till it sets,
away beyond the steeple of the town. But in the
hottest hours it is always refreshing to look, over
the weather-stained tiles of the long low toolhouse,
at the mossy green of the hill that rises there,
cool and shaded, under the trees. Now and then
a bull, of the herd that feeds in the glades of the
wood, comes down that shaded bank, whisking
his tawny sides with an angry tail to keep off the
pestering flies, and his deep bellow reverberates in
the hollow. In the early morning, too, before the
dewy freshness has left the air, the sweet mellow
pipe of the mavis and the fuller notes of the
blackbird float across from these green depths,
and ever and again throughout the day the clear
whistle of some chaffinch comes from behind the
leaves.</p>

<p>Standing here, among the deep box edgings
and gravel paths, it is not difficult to recall the
place’s glory of twenty years ago—the glory upon
which these ancient plum-trees, blossoming yet
against the sunny walls, looked down. To the eye
of Thought, time and space obstruct no clouds,
and in the atmosphere of Memory, the gardens
of the Past bloom for us always. Years and years
agone! It is the day of the fashion for Dutch
bulbs, when fabulous prices were paid for an
unusually ‘fancy’ bulb, and in this garden some
of the finest of them are grown. The tulips are
in flower, and the long narrow beds which, with
scant space between, fill the entire middle of the
garden, are ablaze with the glory of their bloom.
Queenly flowers they are, and tall, each one with a
gentle pedigree—for nothing common or unknown
has entrance here—and crimson, white, and yellow,
the velvet petals of some almost black, striped
with rare and exquisite markings, they raise to
the sun their large chaste chalices. The perfection
of shape is there, as they rise from the midst
of their green, lance-like leaves; no amorous
breeze ever invades the spot to dishevel their
array or filch their treasures; and the precious
golden dust lies in the deep heart of each,
untouched as yet save by the sunshine and the
bee. When the noonday heat becomes too strong,
awnings will be spread above the beds; for
with the fierce glare, the petals would open
out and the pollen fall before the delicate task
of crossing had been done.</p>

<p>But see! Through the gate in the privet
hedge there enters as fair a sight. Ladies in
creamy flowered muslins and soft Indian silks,
shading their eyes from the sun with tiny parasols,
pink and white and green—grand dames of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">{526}</span>
the county, and grander from a distance; gentlemen
in blue swallow-tailed coats and white pantaloons—gallants
escorting their ladies, and connoisseurs
to examine the flowers—all, conducted
by the owner, book in hand, advance into the
garden and move along the beds. For that owner,
an old man with white hair, clear gray eyes,
and the memory of their youthful red remaining
in his cheeks, this is the gala time of the year.
Next month, the beds of ranunculus will bloom,
and pinks and carnations will follow; but the
tulips are his most famous flowers, and, for the
few days while they are in perfection, he leads
about, with his old-world courtesy, replying to
a question here, giving a name or a pedigree
there, a constant succession of visitors. These
are his hours of triumph. For eleven months
he has gone about his beloved pursuit, mixing
loams and leaf-moulds and earths, sorting, drying,
and planting the bulbs, and tending their
growth with his own hand—for to whose, else,
could he trust the work?—and now his toil
has blossomed, and its worth is acknowledged.
Plants envied by peers, plants not to be bought,
are there, and he looks into the heart of each
tenderly, for he knows it a child of his own.</p>

<p>Presently he leads his visitors back into the
house, across the mossy stones of the court, where,
under glass frames, thousands of auricula have
just passed their bloom, and up the outside
stair to the sunny door in the house-side. He
leads them into the shady dining-room, with its
furniture of dark old bees-waxed mahogany,
where there is a slight refreshment of wine
and cake, rare old Madeira, and cake, rich with
eggs and Indian spice, made by his daughter’s
own hand. Jars and glasses are filled with
sweet-smelling flowers, and the breath of the
new-blown summer comes in through the open
doors.</p>

<p>The warm sunlight through the brown linen
blind finds its way across the room, and falls with
subdued radiance on the middle picture of the
opposite wall. The dark eyes, bright cheeks, and
cherry mouth were those of the old man’s wife—the
wife of his youth. She died while the
smile was yet on her lip and the tear of sympathy
in her eye; for she was the friend of all, and
remains yet a tender memory among the neighbouring
poor. The old man is never seen to
look upon that picture; but on Sundays for
hours he sits in reverie by his open Bible here
in the room alone. In a velvet case in the corner
press there, lies a silver medal. It was pinned to
his breast by the Third George on a great day
at Windsor long ago. For the old man peacefully
ending his years here among the flowers, in his
youth served the king, and fought, as a naval
officer, through the French and Spanish wars.
As he goes quietly about, alone, among his
garden beds, perchance he hears again sometimes
the hoarse word of command, the quick tread of
the men, and the deep roar of the heavy guns,
as his ship goes into action. The smoke of these
battles rolled leeward long ago, and their glory
and their wounds are alike forgotten. In that
press, too, lies the wonderful ebony flute, with
its marvellous confusion of silver keys, upon
which he used to take pleasure in recalling the
stirring airs of the fleet. It has played its last
tune; the keys are untouched now, and it is
laid past, warped by age, to be fingered by its
old master no more.</p>

<p>But his guests rise to leave, and, receiving
with antique grace their courtly acknowledgments,
he attends the ladies across the stone-paved hall
to their carriages.</p>

<p>Many years ago! The old man since then
has himself been carried across that hall to his
long home, and no more do grand dames visit
the high-walled garden. But the trees whisper
yet above it; the warmth of summer beats on
the gravelled walks; and the flowers, lovely as
of old in their immortal youth, still open their
stainless petals to the sun.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ABOUT_COBRAS">ABOUT COBRAS.</h2>
</div>
<p class="ph3">BY AN OFFICER.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> at home on furlough from India a short
time ago, I was much amused at finding a very
general impression among my friends that to
come across a cobra is an every-day kind of
occurrence in India. How erroneous this idea
is may be gathered from the fact that not many
days ago a brother-officer told me that although
he had been about ten years in India, he had
never yet seen a cobra in a wild state. His is,
it is true, probably an exceptional case; but still
it shows that an Englishman may pass a considerable
time in India without coming across
one of these venomous reptiles. Cobras, however,
are met with quite often enough, and sometimes
in very curious and uncomfortable places. For
instance, a young lady who had just returned
from a ball in a small station in Southern India,
noticed, as she was on the point of getting into
bed, that the pillow looked disarranged; and on
taking it up to smooth it out, she discovered a
cobra coiled up underneath it. She called out
for assistance; and her father coming to the
rescue, speedily despatched the obnoxious intruder
with a stick. I happened to mention this circumstance
to an officer one day, and he informed
me that the very same thing had happened to
himself soon after his first arrival in the country,
and that, in consequence, he never got into bed
until he had examined the pillows.</p>

<p>In the year 1873, while quartered at Bellary,
on going into the drawing-room of the bungalow,
which at that time I shared with a friend, I
discovered a cobra curled up on the sofa cushion.
I hastened out of the room to fetch a stick; but
in doing so, I must, I suppose, have made some
noise, as on returning the snake had disappeared.
A few evenings later, however, just as my ‘chum’
was leaving the house to go out to dinner, he
called out to me that there was a snake crawling
up the steps of the veranda in front of the
drawing-room. I ran out with a stick, and succeeded
in killing the unwelcome visitor. It
turned out to be a fairly large cobra, and was
in all probability the one which I had seen a
few days previously on the sofa. It is, however,
in the bathrooms of an Indian bungalow that
cobras, when met with within doors, are most
frequently encountered, as they come there in
pursuit of the frogs which delight to take up
their quarters there; for froggy is an article of
diet to which the cobra is very partial. An
officer of the Madras cavalry, since deceased,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">{527}</span>
told me that when quartered at Arcot, he one
day observed in his bathroom, emerging from
the waste-water pipe, the head of a cobra, which
was holding in his mouth a frog. The pipe was
too narrow to admit of the snake’s withdrawing
his head unless he released his victim; this,
however, from unwillingness to forego his meal,
he would not do, and in consequence, paid the
penalty for his gluttony with his life.</p>

<p>One day, my wife’s ayah came running into
our bedroom saying there was a large snake in
the bathroom. Arming myself as usual with a
stick, I went into the bathroom just in time to
see the snake disappear into the waste-water
pipe, which ran under another small room to
the back of the house, where the water found
its outlet. The servants stationed themselves at
the outlet, while I endeavoured to drive the
reptile out from the rear, first with my stick,
and afterwards by pouring the contents of a kettle
of boiling water down the pipe. Both attempts
to dislodge the intruder from his position proving
ineffectual, I commenced a vigorous assault on
him by thrusting a bamboo about five feet long
down the pipe, and this time success rewarded
my efforts, and the snake, driven from his refuge,
was killed by the servants outside. This cobra
measured about five feet six inches in length,
and was the largest that I have ever seen killed.
I may here mention that the ordinary ideas
about the size attained by this species of snake
are greatly exaggerated. Some years ago, a
surgeon-major serving in the Madras presidency,
with whom I was acquainted, took a great interest
in this matter, and offered a considerable
reward to any one who would bring him a cobra
six feet in length; but, if my memory serves
me right, the reward was never gained, although
a very large number of cobras were produced for
his inspection.</p>

<p>Once I witnessed a wonderful escape from the
almost invariably fatal effects of a cobra bite.
I was marching with some native troops in the
cold weather, and halted for the night at a place
called Maikur, where, instead of having our tents
pitched, my wife and I preferred occupying a
small bungalow belonging to the department of
Public Works, which was situated opposite the
encamping-ground. Sitting outside the bungalow
after dinner, I had occasion to call my head-servant
to give him some orders for the next
morning. As he ran up, I saw him kick something
off his left foot, and at the same time he
called out: ‘Sāmp, sahib, sāmp!’ (‘A snake,
sir, a snake.’) There was a bright wood-fire
burning close by, and I saw by its light the
snake with its hood up. It was immediately
killed by some of the camp-followers, and was
brought to me, and proved to be a small cobra.
On examining my servant’s foot, I found one
tiny puncture on the ankle, on which was a
single drop of blood. The man was at once
taken to the hospital tent, and attended to by
the hospital assistant in medical charge of the
troops, who applied ammonia and did all that
was in his power. I was very anxious about the
man; but he awoke me at the hour for marching
next morning as if nothing had happened, and
for some time apparently experienced no inconvenience.
Some weeks later, however, after we
had reached our destination, his left leg swelled
very much, and he suffered great pain for a
considerable time; but he eventually recovered.
The snake was seen by eight or ten persons
besides myself, and was beyond doubt a cobra;
and the only possible explanation of the man’s
escape seems to be that the reptile must have
bitten something else very shortly before, and
so to a great extent exhausted the deadly poison
in its fangs.</p>

<p>One of our children had a narrow escape,
though of a different kind, when quite a baby.
My wife picked him up one day from the
floor, where he was lying enjoying himself in
baby fashion. She had hardly done so, when
a cobra fell from the roof on the very spot on
which the little one had been disporting himself
the moment before.</p>

<p>On one occasion, a curious native superstition
with regard to the subject of these notes came
to my notice. A cobra which had been killed
in the hut of one of the men was brought up
to be shown to me, when a havildar (native
sergeant) called my attention to the fact that the
end of his tail was blunt, saying in Hindustani:
‘Look, sahib; this is a downright villain; he
has bitten some man, and so lost the tip of
his tail.’ On my making further inquiries, I
was confidently assured that whenever a cobra
bites a man, the tip of his tail invariably becomes
blunted!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MITIS_METAL">MITIS METAL.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> introduction of wrought-iron castings by the
‘Mitis process,’ to which attention has lately been
directed, forms a new and an important departure
in the employment of this class of iron. Up to
the present time, wrought-iron has been worked
into the requisite forms by means of hammering;
whilst a system of stamping in moulds was
deemed a considerable advance in economical
working. It is now, however, proposed to treat
wrought-iron in the same manner as cast-iron—namely,
by melting and pouring it into moulds
made in sand, and corresponding in shape with
the object desired. By such a process a considerable
saving in the cost of production is obtained.
Annealing is found to be unnecessary.</p>

<p>The difficulty which has hitherto barred the
adoption of this method has been the high temperature
to which it has been necessary to heat
the iron before it became sufficiently fluid to flow
into the moulds. Wrought-iron fuses at about
four thousand degrees Fahrenheit, but a considerably
higher temperature had to be obtained before
the metal passed out of the viscid state; and on
reaching this increased heat, it was found to
absorb gases which caused cavities and flaws in
the castings, rendering them worthless, and what
are technically known in the foundry as ‘wasters.’
To obviate this difficulty, Peter Ostberg, a Swedish
engineer, has taken advantage of the fact that the
melting-point in alloys is considerably below that
of their components; and by combining with the
iron a small percentage of aluminium, he has
succeeded in lowering the temperature of fusion
of the mixture to such an extent that excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">{528}</span>
castings can be obtained, the temperature reached
not being high enough to cause the absorption of
gases. The castings are clean and sharp in form,
and remarkably strong and fine in texture, being
in some cases, it is said, half as tough again as
the metal from which they were made. The
great reduction in price cannot fail to procure for
the new process an opening commensurate with
its intrinsic merits.</p>

<p>In the United States and Sweden, Mitis Metal
has already established itself as an article of commerce
at once reliable and economical; and there
can be little doubt that the engineers of this
country will avail themselves of this new form of
iron, placed at their disposal by an invention
which promises to rival in importance any introduced
into this branch of industry for many years
past.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak smallertext" id="MISSION_TO_DEEP-SEA_FISHERMEN">MISSION TO DEEP-SEA FISHERMEN.</h2>
</div>


<p>In the year 1844, the Thames Church Mission
was instituted. A few years ago, an accidental development
of the organisation led to the establishment
of a missionary enterprise among the fishermen
engaged in the North Sea. But the possibilities
of the new field of labour soon justified the
formation of a separate body to cope with them;
and on the 30th of November 1884, the Mission
to Deep-sea Fishermen was started. Its primary
object is to give religious teaching to the twelve
thousand men and lads who labour on the twelve
fishing-fleets cruising in the North Sea. It has
six smacks in its service, a seventh being, at the
time of writing, on the stocks. These smacks
supplement their philanthropic labours by fishing
with the fleets with which they sail. Each vessel
carries a missionary skipper, who, as often as the
weather will permit, gathers together in his
spacious hold a congregation of fellow-fishermen
for worship. The earnestness of a devout mariner
has often been noted; and from a short cruise the
writer recently took on one of the Mission vessels,
he can testify not only to the exceptional enthusiasm
and fervour which characterised the services
held on board, but also to the sound moral tone
which, as a result of such services, prevails
generally in the fleets—a condition of things in
happy contrast to the riots and crimes which were
rife there in former years.</p>

<p>But not only are the Mission vessels centres
of religious instruction; each carries a quantity
of healthy literature, which, circulating through
the fleets, beguiles many a fisherman’s leisure
hour of its tedium. Then, too, medicine-chests
and surgical appliances are always kept on
board; and with these at hand, the skipper and
mate, qualified by their certificates from the St
John’s Ambulance Association and the National
Health Society, treat the sick and injured fishermen
of the fleet, who would otherwise suffer until
reaching land the pangs of untreated disorders
and undressed wounds. Besides this, each missionary
skipper labours to promulgate temperance
principles among the fleets both by personal
example and gentle persuasion. Another feature
of the Mission’s work is the collecting and forwarding
of knitted cuffs and comforters—made
by friends on shore—to the North Sea fishermen,
as preventives against the terrible ‘sea-blisters’
which oil-skins produce on unprotected wrists and
necks. Lastly, we should mention that the fishermen
of the fleets are encouraged to come frequently
aboard the Mission vessels to join in
social gossip over a mug of cocoa. Thus each of
these vessels exists in the various capacities of
church, library, temperance hall, dispensary, and
social lounge. The methods by which the Mission
has fought the ‘coper’ or ‘floating grog-shop’
are tolerably well known, and so need not be
dwelt upon here.</p>

<p>Glancing at statistics, we note that, during last
year, there were 1856 visits paid to vessels; 10,375
attendants at the seven hundred services held;
515 temperance pledges were taken; 74,127
tracts and 45,258 magazines distributed; 2725
cases medically and surgically treated; 6665 comforters,
16,210 pairs of cuffs, and 668 helmets,
given away; and 626 copies of the Scriptures sold.
Thus the Mission shows a most healthy growth.
It has recently been established in new offices at
181 Queen Victoria Street, London, E.C.; and a
new phase of its enterprise is the circulation of a
twopenny monthly journal entitled <i>Toilers of the
Deep</i>, being a ‘record of Mission-work among
them.’ The magazine is an excellent one, and
we commend it to all who feel an interest in
the twelve thousand men and boys ‘who toil
through furious blast and sleety storm—who
hazard their lives, and fall victims, hundreds of
them, to the pitiless waves, that markets at home
may be well supplied.’</p>
